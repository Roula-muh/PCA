# PCA
Principal component analysis (PCA) to explore the population structure of the Castanea alabamensis species 
For this project, I decided to perform a principal component analysis to explore the population structure of the Castanea alabamensis species (Perkins et al., 2019). PCA is beneficial to visualize the clustering of data using a scatterplot. It is especially important to perform PCA on large datasets since it reduces the dimensionality of these types of datasets. Reducing dimensionality allows for better visualization of data. PCA can also be used to filter noisy datasets to represent a large dataset with a smaller subset (Jolliffe & Cadima, 2016). The study that was used to retrieve the dataset performed PCA in R whereas this assignment will focus on PCA done using Plink version 1.9.
